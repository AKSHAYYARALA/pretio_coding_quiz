Code must be written in Python 3, and should have unit tests to handle server errors.

Consume an API endpoint (located at https://atlas.pretio.in/atlas/coding_quiz) which returns a list of offers. Order the offers by the payout and print them into a csv. 

10% of the time the endpoint will spit out a 429. Your code should gracefully handle this error, sleep for 60 seconds and then retry the request. 
10% of the time the endpoint will spit out a 500. Your code should handle the error, print it and exit.

Authorization to the endpoint is done via Bearer token: LpNe5bB4CZnvkWaTV9Hv7Cd37JqpcMNF
The endpoint will return a 401 if it's unauthorized. 

Please include two unit tests: one to handle the case where the endpoint returns a 429 and one to handle the case where the endpoint returns a 500.

Please submit the offers.csv via email and upload your code to a public repository (bitbucket, github, gitlab, etc...) and provide the url.
